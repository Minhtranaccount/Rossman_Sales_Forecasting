# Rossman_Sales_Forecasting

**Project background:**

In this project, I have investigated a real-world problem for Rossmann, a drug company that operates over 3,000 drug stores in seven European countries. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.

**Business question: **

What is the aggregated sales output when viewed according to months, and what insights can be found regarding the contribution of running a promotion? 

**Steps taken: **

- Introduction
- Ethical Considerations
- Variable explaination
- Data wrangling (merging data with correct validation)
- Data cleaning (treat outliers and missing values)
- Data visulisation and insights
